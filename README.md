# Origins
As I started running an ME: Andromeda inspired Starfinder campaign I found some things are missing that I could easily automate so I made a little collection for it.

# What does it do?
Currently, here are the functions:
- Mystic automatically recharges the proper amount of vitality network points in encounter mode at the start of their turn.
- Players can toggle their environmental protection on/off.

# Settings
## Mystic Network Recharge
[GM] Toggles whether mystic recharges their vitality network points on the start of their encounter turns automatically.

# Contribution
If you have suggestions for settings or features please let me know by opening an issue with the suggestion tag!

# You can support me on Ko-Fi!
Not at all required, but I'm always happy to have a bit more spending money, uni life is though >.<
